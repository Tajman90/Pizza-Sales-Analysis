# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview 
We set out to analyse the key indicators for Pizza Sales data to gain insight into the business performance. We calculated the following:: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders and Average Pizza Sold.
## Problem Statement
### Charts Requirement
We would like to visualise various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** Create a line chart that illustrate the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high hour activity.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Sales:** Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preference for pizza size and their impact on sales.
5. **Total Pizza Sold by Category:** Create a funnel chart that present the total number of pizza sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.
6. **Top Five Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders:** Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders.
The chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.
7. **Bottom Five Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders:** Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders.
This chart will help us to identify underperforming of less popular pizza option.
